# LinkTreeClone
This is my first ever project. I had loads of help following Danny Thompson's tutorial on Youtube.
I have been postponing starting a project mostly because of imposter syndrome or wanting to build a perfect project.
However, my project doesn't need to cure cancer or anything like that. 
The most important thing is that I begin and build from there.
I love Python as a language but I definetely had fun going back to the HTML/CSS roots.
